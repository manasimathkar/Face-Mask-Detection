# Face Mask Detection Using OpenCV

In response to the urgent need for enhanced Covid-19 safety protocols, a project was initiated to leverage artificial intelligence for public health safety, specifically focusing on the accurate classification of face mask usage. This initiative began with advanced data visualization techniques applied to a dataset, setting the groundwork for effective model training. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model training and optimization, ensuring the system's accuracy in identifying the presence of face masks. For practical application, the trained model was integrated with OpenCV, enabling real-time face mask detection within organizations, thus supporting efforts to maintain health safety standards. The entire system was scripted in Python, facilitating efficient integration and deployment. This tailored solution not only addressed immediate health safety needs but also underscored the pivotal role of AI in enhancing public health measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.
